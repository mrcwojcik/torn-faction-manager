# Torn Faction Manager

Torn Faction Manager is backend application to manage running a faction in text-browser game Torn. It helps to check members activity. TFM is working with frontend application and Discord bot.

At the moment it's written directly for one faction.

## Todo & Plans

* Basic settings to run application for any faction;
* Tracking of part of members activity (like who should get bonus hit during chain or who is "best" member in month)
